The Touchlab Driver Library provides an interface for communicating with Touchlab sensors.
It supports reading raw and calibrated data, managing sensor offsets,
and configuring the sensors.
The library is implemented in c++ and provided as a pre-compiled binary from Linux and Windows. You can download the latest version [here](https://github.com/touchlab-avatarx/touchlab_driver_cpp/releases).

The library is designed to be easy to use and integrate into new and existing projects.
All functionality is exposed through API implemented in a single class.

Read our the [documentation](https://touchlab-avatarx.github.io/touchlab_driver_cpp/) learn about the [API](https://touchlab-avatarx.github.io/touchlab_driver_cpp/api.html) and [example usage](https://touchlab-avatarx.github.io/touchlab_driver_cpp/example.html).
